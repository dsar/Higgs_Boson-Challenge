# PCML_Project-1

## Exploratory analysis on CERN Data.

### Input Data
Download the input Higgs boson Data from [Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/epfml-project-1/data)
and add it to `Data/` folder.

### Test Code
To run the algorithm that gives us the best score (published in [kaggle Leaderboard](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/epfml-project-1/leaderboard)), run the `scripts/run.py` file
<br />
To test all the algorithms one-by-one and get a better idea, open the `scripts/project1.ipynb`. The default degree in "Polynomial expansion" cell is 12. It works well for methods with linear equations but you might need to reduce it in order to run the gradient descent methods due to some numerical issues.
